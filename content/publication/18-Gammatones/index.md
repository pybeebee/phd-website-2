abstract: "Current approaches to speech emotion recognition focus on speech features that can capture the emotional content of a speech signal. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (MFCCs) are one of the most commonly used representations for audio speech recognition and classification. This paper proposes Gammatone Frequency Cepstral Coefficients (GFCCs) as a potentially better representation of speech signals for emotion recognition. The effectiveness of MFCC and GFCC representations are compared and evaluated over emotion and intensity classification tasks with fully connected and recurrent neural network architectures. The results provide evidence that GFCCs outperform MFCCs in speech emotion recognition."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'GFCCs can be powerful speech features for use in speech emotion recognition. This preliminary study suggests they are more suitable versus MFCCs for emotion and intensity classification tasks with neural networks.'
