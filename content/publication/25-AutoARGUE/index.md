abstract: "Generation of long-form, citation-backed reports is a primary use case for retrieval augmented generation (RAG) systems. While opensource evaluation tools exist for various RAG tasks, ones tailored to
report generation (RG) are lacking. Accordingly, we introduce AutoARGUE, a robust LLM-based implementation of the recently proposed ARGUE framework for RG evaluation. We present analysis of AutoARGUE on the RG pilot task from the TREC 2024 NeuCLIR track, showing good system-level correlations with human judgments. We further release a web app for visualization of Auto-ARGUE outputs."

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
summary: 'Report generation (RG) is a RAG task that aims to produce a long-form, citation-attributed response to a complex user query. We present the first public, automated, LLM-based implementation of the ARGUE evaluation framework for RG.'
