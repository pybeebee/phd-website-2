  abstract = "Metacognition of emotion (meta-emotion) refers to the ability to
              evaluate and identify one's emotional feelings. No previous study
              has defined and measured this construct through objective and
              quantitative procedures. We established a reliable method to
              measure meta-emotion. With a two-interval forced-choice
              procedure, participants selected which of two pictures elicited
              stronger positive emotion; via the Law of Comparative Judgment,
              their responses were used to compute individual psychological
              distances for the emotional responses triggered by the pictures.
              Then, participants were asked to judge whether a pre-exposed
              picture induced a stronger positive emotion than the median of
              that elicited by the whole picture set, followed by a confidence
              rating. By utilizing each individual's psychological distance,
              the correctness of a participant's emotional experience was
              quantified by d', and meta-emotion was quantified using meta-d',
              M-ratio, and M-diff as indices of metacognitive sensitivity and
              efficiency based on Signal-Detection Theory. Test-retest
              reliabilities, validated by Spearman correlation, were observed
              in meta-d', M-ratio, and marginally with M-diff, suggesting the
              stability of meta-emotion in the current design. This study
              unveils a validated procedure to quantify meta-emotion,
              extendable for assessing metacognition of other subjective
              feelings. Nevertheless, caution is warranted in interpretation,
              as the measured processes may be influenced by non-metacognitive
              factors.",
